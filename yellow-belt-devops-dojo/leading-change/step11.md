With Chun's coaching and Paulo's guidance, and the engagement and support of the executive team, the group decided to focus on the following areas:

* Value Stream Mapping

* DevOps Kaizen

* Test Driven Development

* Continuous Testing

* Continuous Integration

* Version Control

* Shift Left on Security

* Post Incident Practices

There are dedicated modules in the initial stripe of the **Yellow Belt DevOps Dojo** which cover each of these topics in detail. The modules cover the topics in the context of the journey which the Pet Clinic team undertook as part of their DevOps Transformation.

Our hope is that you will find the modules useful and enjoyable, and that they will help you to empower yourself as change agent within your own team.
