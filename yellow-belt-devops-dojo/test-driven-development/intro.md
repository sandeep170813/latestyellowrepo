## Welcome!

The primary objective of the "Test Driven Development" (TDD) module is to help you to understand the principles and benefits of TDD so that you and your team apply TDD in your daily work.

The secondary objective is to give you an opportunity to complete a TDD real world scenario using Katacoda in **your** Sandbox environment.

Remember the Sandbox is your personal clone of the Pet Clinic Repository. The Sandbox is the one which you created in the Welcome module. You are free to experiment in your Sandbox without fear of impacting the lab or other learners.

If you have not completed the Welcome module **and** the continuous testing module, you must do so before continuing with the TDD module.

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of the lesson, you should be able to:

* articulate the benefits of TDD,
* understand the principles of applying TDD,
* adapt TDD practices in your own activities.
