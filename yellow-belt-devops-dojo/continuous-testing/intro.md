## Welcome!

Welcome to the **Yellow Belt DevOps Dojo** lab on Continuous Testing and Test  
Automation.  
If you have not completed the Welcome module you must do so before continuing
with this module.

## Purpose

The primary objective of the "Continuous Testing / Test Automation" module is to understand the principles and benefits of Continuous Testing and Test Automation.

The secondary objective is to complete a Continuous Testing real world scenario using Katacoda in your Sandbox environment.

The Sandbox is your personal clone of the Pet Clinic Repository. The Sandbox is the one which you created in the Welcome module.
You are free to experiment in your Sandbox without fear of impacting the lab or other learners.

By the end of the lesson and lab, you will be able to

- Articulate the benefits of Continuous Testing and Test Automation
- Understand the principles of applying Continuous Testing and Test Automation in your continuous integration/delivery pipelines
- Adapt Continuous Testing and Test Automation practices in your own activities.
